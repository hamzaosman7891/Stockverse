# Stockverse - Portfolio Mangamnet Website

The aim of the project is to build a web application, which allows users to manage their stock
investments. This app includes the function of tracking purchases, sales and observing
stock prices. The project delivers a web app that obtains stock quotes using the IEX API.
Users are able to register and after registering users are able to log in and are then
able to buy and sell stocks. Users are able to observe the stock prices, previous close,
market cap, YTD change, 52Wk high and the 52Wk low of each stock quote as the IEX API
provides real-time values. In addition, users are able to see a distribution chart of
their portfolio.
